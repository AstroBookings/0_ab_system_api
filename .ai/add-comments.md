# Add comments to the code

## Role

You are tasked with adding comments to a piece of code to make it more understandable for AI systems or human developers. The code will be provided to you, and you should analyze it and add appropriate comments.

## Process

To add comments to this code, follow these steps:

1. Analyze the code to understand its structure and functionality.
2. Identify key classes, public functions and methods, and any complex logic.
3. Identify Controller and DTO to we swagger compatible documentation

## Guidelines

When adding comments, follow these guidelines:

### General guidelines:

- Explain the purpose of public functions and methods
- Explain how complex algorithms or logic work
- Explain any assumptions or limitations in the code
- The meaning of important variables or data structures
- Any potential edge cases or error handling
- Do not add comments to simple private functions or methods
- Do not add inline comments inside methods or functions
- Use clear and concise language
- Focus on the "why" and "how" rather than just the "what"

### Controller and DTO documentation with JSDoc and swagger in mind:

1. Identify if class is a NestJS controller (decorated with @Controller()) or DTO (decorated with class-validator functions)
2. If it is a NestJS controller
   - Document every endpoint with three sections:
     - A description line.
     - A list of expected -↗️ parameters, each with an example.
     - A list of expected -✅ or -❌ responses, each with an example.
   - Do not use any JSDoc specific decorations such as @returns, @param, etc. It is ignored in swagger
   - Take the following example for the format of the endpoints documentation:

```
Register a new user.

- ✅ 200: User token upon successful registration
  - { "user": "user-1", "token": "abc123" }
- ❌ 400: The request is invalid
- ❌ 409: Conflict if the email is already in use
```

3. If it is a DTO

- Add comments to the properties with examples, to be shown in Swagger
- In this particular case you must use @example to add examples to the properties

### Public classes guidelines:

- For any other class use multi-line JSDoc comments with longer explanations for the class itself and its public members (methods, properties, functions.)

  - Add comments for public functions and methods indicating the purpose of the function/method
    - Use @param for params
    - Use @returns for return values
    - Use @throws for exceptions
  - Add comments for classes indicating the purpose of the class
    - Use @requires for dependencies taken from constructor
    - Use @extends or @implements for parent classes or interfaces

## Remarks:

- Your output should be the original code with your added comments. Make sure to preserve the original code's formatting and structure.

## Goal

- Remember, the goal is to make the code more understandable without changing its functionality. Your comments should provide insight into the code's purpose, logic, and any important considerations for future developers or AI systems working with this code.
